SeedStack provides a number of predefined project templates that can be generated from [Maven archetypes](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html).<!--more--> 
We recommend that you use these project templates, especially if you are new to SeedStack as they provide several benefits:

* They are immediately executable and deployable after generation,
* They follow best practices, providing clean code organization and good modularity,
* They are easy to use and provide fast onboarding.
