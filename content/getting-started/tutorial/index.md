Welcome to the SeedStack tutorial! It is intended to walk you through the most interesting features of SeedStack, by 
making you build a simple Web application from scratch.<!--more-->

{{% callout info %}}
SeedStack can be used for any type of project and provides templates for several [predefined project types](../project-templates).
This tutorial is focused on a **[REST microservice project](../project-templates/rest)**.

# Project generation

The first step is to create the Web application using the latest project template:

```plain
mvn org.seedstack:seedstack-maven-plugin:generate
```
    
The generator will ask you a few questions, below are the recommended answers:

* Project type: `rest`,
* Project group id: `org.myorg.myapp`,
* Project artifact id: `my-app`.

This will create the project in the `my-app` subdirectory of the current directory.
 
# First build

The project is immediately buildable. Go into the project directory and run the following command:

```plain
mvn clean install
```

{{% callout info %}}
The build process will create a [Capsule](http://capsule.io) of the project. A capsule is a standalone JAR containing
all the files and dependencies of the project. The capsule can be launched with:

```plain
java -jar target/my-app-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-capsule.jar
```    
{{% /callout %}}

# First run

In development you can run the application without building the capsule:
  
```plain
mvn seedstack:run
```
    
When the application has started, you can display the Web UI by pointing your Browser of choice at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You can now import the project in your IDE if desired.

# Displaying configuration options
 
You can display all configuration options of your SeedStack project by running:

    mvn org.seedstack:seedstack-maven-plugin:config

If you want more information about a particular option:
 
    mvn org.seedstack:seedstack-maven-plugin:config name.of.option
