The `package` goal packages any self-executable SeedStack application in a [Capsule](http://www.capsule.io/).
A Capsule is a way of packaging and running any application with all its dependencies from a unique plain executable JAR.<!--more-->

{{% callout info %}}
Self-executable SeedStack application are applications that contains one and only one implementation of the {{< java "org.seedstack.seed.spi.SeedLauncher" >}}
interface in their classpath, like the one provided by the `seed-cli` module (for command-line application) or the `seed-web-undertow`
module (for embedded Web applications).

# Examples

## Standalone Capsule

A standalone Capsule packs all its dependencies and is completely self-contained. It is the default mode of operation. To
build such a Capsule, use the following command:

    mvn org.seedstack:seedstack-maven-plugin:package

# Running a capsule

To run a capsule, you simply execute it as a plain executable JAR:

    java [jvm-args] -jar my-capsule.jar [args...]

In addition to any argument already specified in the capsule manifest (with the plugin parameters described above), you can specify any argument to the JVM or to the program as usual.

{{% callout tips %}}
A lot of options can be specified to alter the default behavior of the Capsule itself. Please refer to the [Capsule user-guide](http://www.capsule.io/user-guide/)
for more information.
